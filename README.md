You should run a sample dapp here: https://github.com/gadillacer/juicy-nft-demo

Steps:
1. git clone https://github.com/gadillacer/juicy-nft-demo
2. Yarn install
3. Yarn start

Then enjoy it with freemint NFTs(your gas was sponsored)

***
Okay, after that you can click the link in the site or go to https://juccipay.vercel.app to fund some gas with your web3 wallet.

###
You can sell your minted NFTs with our NFT AMM also.

***
note: The site was deployed on Polygon Mumbai, and you need at least 1 Matic to fund gas

Good luck.
